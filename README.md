# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Brian Pfaff*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Signal: orange
Power: red
Ground: brown 

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

pin 9 

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

so the Speed of movement is ```     delay(50); ``` function in the code where as the angle that the motor goes to is controlled by the if statement ```  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) ``` and ```for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1)```

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
